# Neural-networks
 Implementation of basic neural networks algorithms for classification and clustering.
 All algorithms are implemented in C. The whole algotrithms are implemented without the use of ready-made functions.
 Algorithms: K-means, LVQ, MLP.
 I also created a program which generates random points (randompoints.c)
 In the directory you can also find a train file and a text file.
